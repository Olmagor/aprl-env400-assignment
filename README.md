# EPFL ENV-400 data analysis assigment, Spring 2016

This is an exercise for analyzing air quality monitoring network data assigned in Air Pollution and Climate Change. Students are assumed to have a little programming background, mostly in MATLAB/Octave. The R code is partially written with pedagogical intentions, so may not be the most efficient.

Topics addressed are the following:

1. [Motivating example](./contents/01_Rintro.html)
2. [Assignment definition](./contents/02_projectdef.html)
3. [R basics](./contents/03_Rbasics.html)
4. [Visualizing time series](./contents/04_tseriesviz.html)
5. [Correlations and cross-correlations](./contents/05_correlations.html)
6. Autocorrelation and periodicity
7. Stochastic processes and random variables 
8. Normal processes and the central limit theorem
9. Lognormal processes and environmental dispersion
10. Extreme values: detection and accommodation

We recommend interfacing with R through [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/), which you can also download on your own machine. Note that when using RStudio, you can set `Sessions -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.`
