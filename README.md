# Analysis of Swiss National Air Pollution Monitoring Network (NABEL) Measurements

This is an exercise for analyzing air quality monitoring network data assigned in the Air Pollution and Climate Change (ENV-400) Masters class at EPFL. This pratical work complements separate lectures and exercises provided in the classroom. Students are assumed to have a little programming background, mostly in MATLAB/Octave. The R code is partially written with pedagogical intentions, so may not be the most efficient.

We recommend interfacing with R through [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/), which you can also download on your own machine. Note that when using RStudio, you can set `Sessions -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.`
