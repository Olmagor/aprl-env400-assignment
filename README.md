# Analysis of Swiss National Air Pollution Monitoring Network (NABEL) Measurements

This is an exercise for analyzing air quality monitoring network data assigned in the Air Pollution and Climate Change (ENV-400) Masters class at EPFL. Students are assumed to have a little programming background, mostly in MATLAB/Octave. The R code is partially written with pedagogical intentions, so may not be the most efficient.

Topics addressed are the following:

5. <a href="http://rawgit.com/stakahama/aprl-env400-assignment/master/contents/05_correlations.html" target="_blank">Correlations and cross-correlations</a>
6. Autocorrelation and periodicity
7. Stochastic processes and random variables 
8. Normal processes and the central limit theorem
9. Lognormal processes and environmental dispersion
10. Extreme values: detection and accommodation

We recommend interfacing with R through [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/), which you can also download on your own machine. Note that when using RStudio, you can set `Sessions -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.`
